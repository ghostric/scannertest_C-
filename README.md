#scanner test in C++
This program is for learning and understanding vulnarability assesment scanners and to build a new VAS program in C++ that will use "smart" methods to manage processes rather than "brute force" scanning methods. 

Goal for this portion:
- to log running processes in an outfile with runtime, description of process, and 
in broad terms safe or unsafe.
- record activity of each program 
- give percent amount on how "vulnerable" system is

all this to be recorded in personal log.txt files 

fairly simple idea but has a very long way to go.
as of 7/10/2018 this is non-funcitoning and a very rough start
this is to be a 'dummy' program for learning purposes.

thank you!
